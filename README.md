PRESENTATION: CSS for Programmers (2018 Edition)

There are three intrinsically interrelated technologies at play in modern web development -- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These technologies are core to the platform and inseparable. Successful web developers must be well-balanced in all three.

In this talk, Scott Davis (Principal Engineer, ThoughtWorks) teases out the rigorous engineering principles behind CSS in an updated version of one of his most popular presentations for programmers. Fonts and colors are not the point of this talk; adopting a declarative mindset is. We'll explore selectors and pseudo-selectors, CSS constants (aka "custom properties") and pseudo-classes, Responsive Web Design, modern layout options like Flexbox and Grid, and much more.
